# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble Sort
**How It Works?**
1. Compare adjacent elements in the array and swap if they are not in the intended order.
2. Repeat as you got through each element.
3. Once you go through the array with no swaps, the array is sorted.

Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array.

```
ie.
arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
bubbleSort(arr) => [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]
```

```js
  const bubbleSort = (arr) => {
    let swap = false;
    do { // There are two loops and we go through the whole array in both loops. O(n^2)
      swap = false;
      for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i+1]) {
          let temp = arr[i];
          arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
          arr[i+1] = temp;
          swap = true;
        }
      }
    } while (swap)
    return arr;
  }
```

Visualization:
```
First iteration
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] => [-6, 20] don't need swapping.
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] => [20, 8] need to be swapped.
[-6, 8, 20, -2, 4] => [20, -2] need to be swapped.
[-6, 8, -2, 20, 4] => [20, 4] need to be swapped.

If there was any swapping, we iterate once more.

Second iteration
[-6, 8, -2, 4, 20] => [-6, 8] don't need swapping.
[-6, 8, -2, 4, 20] => [8, -2] need to be swapped.
[-6, -2, 8, 4, 20] => [8, 4] need to be swapped.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [8, 20] don't need swapping.

If there was any swapping, we iterate once more.

Third iteration
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [-6, -2] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [-2, 4] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [4, 8] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [8, 20] don't need swapping.

There was no swapping in this iteration, so we return the sorted array.
