# Miscellaneous Problems
## Cartesian Product of Two Sets
Cartesian product of two sets A and B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is from set A and b from set B.

Problem - Given two finite non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product.

```
ie.
const A = [1, 2]
const B = [3, 4]
const C = [3, 4, 5]

cartesianProduct(A, B) = [[1,3], [1, 4], [2,3], [2,4]]
cartesianProduct(A, C) = [[1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5]]
```

```js
const cartesianProduct = (arrA, arrB) => { //This has two nested loops that may vary in length so O(n*m)
  const result = [];
  
  for (const a of arrA) {
    for (const b of arrB) {
      result.push([a,b]);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

## Climbing Staircase

Problem - Given a staircase of n steps, count the number of distinct ways to climb to the top. You can either climb 1 or 2 stetps at a time.

```
ie.
n = 1, climbingStaircase(1) = 1        | Can only be climbed (1);
n = 2, climbingStaircase(2) = 2        | Can be climbed in steps of 1 (1,1) or one step of 2 (2).
n = 3, climbingStaircase(3) = 3        | (1,1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
n = 4, climbingStaircase(4) = 5        | (1,1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2) and (2,2).
```

```js
const climbingStaircase = (n) => { // One for-loop that iterates the amount inputted thus O(n) 
  let numOfWays = [0, 1, 2];

  if (n > 2) {
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
      numOfWays.push(numOfWays[i-1] + numOfWays[i-2])
    }
  }

  return numOfWays[n];
}
```

## Tower of Hanoi
Problem - Given a tower of Hanoi, move the entire stack to the last rod with the following constraints:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller.

Hint:
1. Shift 'n-1' disks from rod A to rod B, using rod C (when required).
2. Shift last disk from rod A to rod C.
3. Shift 'n-1' disks from rod B to rod C, using rod A (when required).

```
ie.
towerOfHanoi(n = number of disks, starting rod, end rod, middle rod);
towerOfHanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B') will log:
  Move disk 1 from A to C
  Move disk 2 from A to B
  Move disk 1 from C to B
  Move disk 3 from A to C
  Move disk 1 from B to A
  Move disk 2 from B to C
  Move disk 1 from A to C

Which is how the problem is solved.

```

```js
const towerOfHanoi = (n, fromRod, toRod, usingRod) => {// This is O(2^n);
  if(n === 1) {
    console.log(`Move disk 1 from ${fromRod} to ${toRod}`);
    return;
  }
  towerOfHanoi(n-1, fromRod, usingRod, toRod);
  console.log(`Move disk ${n} from ${fromRod} to ${toRod}`);
  towerOfHanoi(n-1, usingRod, toRod, fromRod);
}
```
