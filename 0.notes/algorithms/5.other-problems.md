## Cartesian Product of Two Sets
Cartesian product of two sets A and B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is from set A and b from set B.

Problem - Given two finite non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product.

```
ie.
const A = [1, 2]
const B = [3, 4]
const C = [3, 4, 5]

cartesianProduct(A, B) = [[1,3], [1, 4], [2,3], [2,4]]
cartesianProduct(A, C) = [[1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5]]
```

```js
const  = () => {
  return ;
}
```

## 

Problem - .

```
ie.
```

```js
const  = () => {
  return ;
}
```
