# Graph
This is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges. Trees are a specific type of graphs.
There are no hierarchies in graphs nor a set way of reading them.

## Types of Graphs
- **Directed**: Graphs in which the edges have a direction and its edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.
- **Undirected**: Graphs in which the edges are bidirectional. The graph can be traversed in either direction. The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.
- Can be made up of only vertices without edges.
- Multiple edges from one node.
- Cycles in the graph.
- Self-loops on a node.
- Disconnected/singled out nodes.
- May have weighted edges.

## Examples of Use
- Google Maps (Cities as vertices and roads as edges)
- Social media sites (Users are vertices and links as edges)

## Implementation
Graphs are represented in two ways:
- Adjacency matrix:
  - a 2D array of size VxV where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
  - Each row and column represent a vertex.
  - If the value of any element, matrix[i][j] is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.
  - The matrix below represents an undirected graph where A - B - C.

      |   | A | B | C |
      | - | - | - | - |
      | A | 0 | 1 | 0 |
      | B | 1 | 0 | 1 |
      | C | 0 | 1 | 0 |

      ```js
      const adjacencyMatrix = [
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0]
      ];
      ```

- Adjacency list:
  - Vertices are stored in a map like data structure, and every vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices.
    ```js
    // A -> [B]
    // B -> [A, C]
    // C -> [B]

    const adjacencyList = {
      'A': ['B'],
      'B': ['A', 'C'],
      'C': ['B']
    }
    ```

This implementation of graphs will assume an adjacency list representation of graphs.
```js
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjacencyList = {}  
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
      this.adjacencyList[vertex] = new Set();
    };
  }

  addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex1]) {
      this.addVertex(vertex1);
    };
    if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex2]) {
      this.addVertex(vertex2);
    };
    this.adjacencyList[vertex1].add(vertex2);
    this.adjacencyList[vertex2].add(vertex1);
  }

  removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    this.adjacencyList[vertex1].delete(vertex2);
    this.adjacencyList[vertex2].delete(vertex1);
  }

  removeVertex(vertex) {
    if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) return;
    for (let adjacentVertex of this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
      this.removeEdge(vertex, adjacentVertex);
    }
    delete this.adjacencyList[vertex];
  }

  hasEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    return (
      this.adjacencyList[vertex1].has(vertex2) &&
      this.adjacencyList[vertex2].has(vertex1)
    )
  }

  display() {
    for (let vertex in this.adjacencyList) {
      console.log(vertex + ' -> ' + [...this.adjacencyList[vertex]]);
    }
  }
}
```

## Adjacency Matrix vs Adjacency List
**Matrix**:
  - Store values regardles of whether an edge exists or not.
  - Inserting and finding adjacent nodes is in linear time.
  - Additional values such as weights have to be stored externally.

**List**:
  - Only need to store the values for the edges that exists. (More efficient storage)
  - Inserting and finding adjacent nodes can be done in constant time. (Insertion and search is more efficient)
  - Allows you to store additional values with an edge such as weights.

## Graph Implementation (Codecademy)
We’ll take an object-oriented approach to build an implementation of the graph data structure in JavaScript. With three classes, Edge, Vertex, and Graph, we can implement a variety of graphs that satisfy the requirements of many algorithms. Remember that a Graph consists of vertices and their corresponding edges.

**Edge:**
- An Edge connects two vertices
- An Edge can store the weight of the connection (to support weighted graphs).

**Vertex:**
- A Vertex can store any data.
- A Vertex maintains a list of connections to other vertices, represented by a list of Edge instances.
- A Vertex can add and remove edges going to another Vertex.

**Graph:**
- A Graph stores all of its vertices, represented by a list of Vertex instances.
- A Graph knows if it is directed or undirected.
- A Graph knows if it is weighted or unweighted.
- A Graph can add and remove its own vertices.
- A Graph can add and remove edges between stored vertices.

**Edge**
```js
class Edge {
  constructor(start, end, weight = null) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
    this.weight = weight;
  }
}

module.exports = Edge;
```

**Vertex**
```js
const Edge = require('./Edge.js');

class Vertex {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.edges = [];
  }

  addEdge(vertex, weight) {
    if (vertex instanceof Vertex) {
      this.edges.push(new Edge(this, vertex, weight));
    } else {
      throw new Error('Edge start and end must both be Vertex');
    }
  }

  removeEdge(vertex) {
    this.edges = this.edges.filter(edge => edge.end !== vertex);
  }

  print() {
    const edgeList = this.edges.map(edge =>
        edge.weight !== undefined ? `${edge.end.data} (${edge.weight})` : edge.end.data) || [];

    const output = `${this.data} --> ${edgeList.join(', ')}`;
    console.log(output);
  }
}

module.exports = Vertex;
```

**Graph**
```js
const Edge = require('./Edge.js');
const Vertex = require('./Vertex.js');

class Graph {
  constructor(isWeighted = false, isDirected = false) {
    this.vertices = [];
    this.isWeighted = isWeighted;
    this.isDirected = isDirected;
  }

  addVertex(data) {
    const newVertex = new Vertex(data);
    this.vertices.push(newVertex);

    return newVertex;
  }

  removeVertex(vertex) {
    this.vertices = this.vertices.filter(v => v !== vertex);
  }

  addEdge(vertexOne, vertexTwo, weight) {
    const edgeWeight = this.isWeighted ? weight : null;

    if (vertexOne instanceof Vertex && vertexTwo instanceof Vertex) {
      if(!this.isDirected) {
        vertexTwo.addEdge(vertexOne, edgeWeight);
      }
      vertexOne.addEdge(vertexTwo, edgeWeight);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Expected Vertex arguments.');
    }
  }

  removeEdge(vertexOne, vertexTwo) {
    if (vertexOne instanceof Vertex && vertexTwo instanceof Vertex) {
      if(!this.isDirected) {
        vertexTwo.removeEdge(vertexOne);
      }
      vertexOne.removeEdge(vertexTwo);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Expected Vertex arguments.');
    }
  }

  print() {
    this.vertices.forEach(vertex => vertex.print());
  }
}
```

## Graph Traversal
### Depth First Search (DFS)
A depth-first graph search continues down a path until it reaches the end. It is helpful for determining if a path exists between two vertices. DFS has many applications, including topological sorting and detecting cycles, but one of the more interesting real-world applications is that it can be used to solve problems that have a singular correct answer (a path between the start state and end state), such as a sudoku exercise.

### Breadth First Search (BFS)
On the other hand, a breadth-first graph search approach checks the values of all neighboring vertices before moving into another level of depth. This is an incredibly inefficient way to find just any path between two vertices, but it’s an excellent way to identify the shortest path between them. Because of this, BFS is helpful for figuring out directions from one place to another.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is a method for finding the shortest distance from a given point to every other point in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by keeping track of all the distances and updating the distances as it conducts a breadth-first search. A common application of this algorithm is to find the quickest route from one destination to another.
