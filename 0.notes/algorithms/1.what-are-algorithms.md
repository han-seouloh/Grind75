# Algorithms
## What Are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

You have an input, a set of instructions (the algorithm) and a resulting output.
``` js
// Input
const [a,b] = [1,1];


// Algorithm (Sum of Two Numbers)
const sumOfTwoNumbers = (a, b) => { // Accepts two inputs (numbers to add).
  const result = a + b; // Sums the two numbers.
  return result; // Outputs the result.
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity is how long the computer takes to run an algorithm as a function of the input size.
Space complexity is how much memory is taken by an algorithm when run as a function of the input size.

These are represented by:
1. Big-0 Notation - Worst case complexity. (This is most used in interviews.)
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity.
3. Theta Notation - Average case complexity.

### Big-O Notation
This is a notation to describe the worst case scenario for time and space complexities.
These are some examples:
#### O(1)
```js
const sum = (a,b) => { // Taking the algorithm of the previous example,
  const result = a + b;
  return result; // Since we only need run the algorithm once to return the output
                 // The time complexity is constant time O(1);
                 // No matter how many times you call this algorithm, this will run in O(n)
}
```

#### O(n)
```js
const sum = nums => { // Depending on the array size of nums.
  let output = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // This for-loop is run said amount of times.
    output += nums[i];
  }

  return output; // Thus the worst case scenario is O(n) where n is the size of the array.
}
```

#### O(n<sup>2</sup>)
```js
const sum = nums => { // Depending on the array size of nums.
  let output = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // This for-loop is run said amount of times.
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) { // And for each previous loop, this for-loop is run the same amount of times.
      output += nums[i];
    }
  }
    // The worst case scenario for the first loop is to loop n times depending on the array size and for each of these loops
    // the second loop is also looping n times.
  return output; // Thus the Big-O notation is O(n^2) .
}
```

#### O(nlogn)
Sorting algorithms usually have this time complexity since usually their is a loop running n times and as the amount
of elements to sort decreases the loop inside the first loop is gradually reduced to log(n). Thus resulting in a
O(nlogn).

#### Space Complexity with Big-O
The previous ways to represent time complexity also applies when describing space complexity.

#### Objects - Big-O (HashMap)
Collection of key value pairs.
```js
const obj = {
  key: 'value',
  ...
}
```

1. Insert - O(1) - Inserting a key-value pair into the object.
2. Remove - O(1) - Removing a key-value pair into the object.
3. Access - O(1) - Accessing a value in the object through its key.
4. Search - O(1) - Searching a key in the object (you must know the key).
5. Object.keys() - O(n) - Returns an array by looping through each key in the object.
6. Object.values() - O(n) - Returns an array by looping through each value in the object.
7. Object.entries() - O(n) - Returns an array by looping through each key-value pair in the object.

#### Arrays - Big-O (HashMap)
Ordered collection of values.
```js
const array = ['val1', 'val2', ...] //[index = 0, index = 1, ...]
```

1. Insert/Remove at the end of the array - O(1) - pop/push in javascript
2. Insert/Remove at the beginning of the array - O(n) - Has to shift all indexes for other values.
3. Access - O(1) - Accessing a value in the object through its index.
4. Search - O(n) - To search it has to loop through the array until it finds the element.
5. shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice - O(n) - see second point.
6. forEach/map/filter/reduce - O(n) - loops through each element of the array to apply an operation.
