# Circular Queue
This is an extended version of a regular queue. 
- The size is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
- AKA circular buffer or ring buffer and follows the FIFO principle.
- A circular queue will reuse the empty block created during the dequeue operation.
- When working with queues of fixed maximum size, a circular queue is a great implementation choice.
- Supports two main operations:
  - Enqueue: adds element to the rear of the collection. (If the defined spaces of the circular queue are full you cannot enqueue anymore)
  - Dequeue: removes element from the head of the collection.

## Examples of Use
- Clock
- Streaming data
- Traffic lights

## Implementation
Operations we'll implement in this circular queue:
- enqueue(val) - add an element to the queue.
- dequeue() - remove the oldest element from the queue.
- isFull() - check if the queue is full.
- isEmpty() - check if the queue is empty.
- peek() - get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- size() - get number of elements in the queue.
- print() - visualize the elements in the queue.

```js
class CircularQueue {
  constructor(capacity) {
    this.items = new Array(capacity);
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.currentLength = 0;
    this.rear = -1;
    this.front = -1;
  }

  isFull () {
    return this.currentLength === this.capacity;
  }
  isEmpty () {
    return this.currentLength === 0;
  }
  enqueue (element) {
    if(!this.isFull()) {
      this.rear = (this.rear + 1) % this.capacity;
      this.items[this.rear] = element;
      this.currentLength ++;
      if(this.front === -1) {
        this.front = this.rear;
      }
    }
  }
  dequeue () {
    if(!this.isEmpty()){
      const item = this.items[this.front];
      this.items[this.front] = null;
      this.front = (this.front + 1) % this.capacity;
      this.currentLength --;
      if (this.isEmpty()) {
        this.front = -1;
        this.rear = -1;
      }
      return item;
    }
    return null;
  }
  peek () {
    return !this.isEmpty() ? this.items[this.front] :  null;
  }
  print () {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      console.log('Queue is empty') 
    } else {
      let i, str = '';
      for (i = this.front; i !== this.rear; i = (i+1) % this.capacity) {
        str += this.items[i] + ' ';
      }
      str += this.items[i];
      console.log(str);
    }
  }
}
