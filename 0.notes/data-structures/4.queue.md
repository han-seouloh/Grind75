# Queue
Sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO).
- The first element inserted into the queue is the first element to be removed.
- The elements stack up entering by the rear/tail and leave the queue from the front/head.
- Abstract data type defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
- Main operations:
  - Enqueue: adds an element to the tail of the collection.
  - Dequeue: removes an element form the head of the collection.

## Examples of Use
- Printers (Document printing order)
- CPU task scheduling
- Callback queue in Javascript Runtime

## Implementation
Operations we'll implement in this queue:
- enqueue(val) - add an element to the queue.
- dequeue() - remove the oldest element from the queue.
- peek() - get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty() - check if the queue is empty.
- size() - get number of elements in the queue.
- print() - visualize the elements in the queue.

```js
class Queue {
  constructor(arr = []) {
    this.items = [...arr];
  }

  onqueue (element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }
  dequeue () {
    return this.items.shift();
  }
  isEmpty () {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
  peek () {
    return this.items.length > 0 ? this.items[0] : null;
  }
  size () {
    return this.items.length;
  }
  print () {
    console.log(this.items.toString());
  }
}
```
