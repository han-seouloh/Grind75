# Heap
Heaps are another variation of the tree data structure and are adept at keeping track of the maximum or minimum value held within, referred to as max-heaps and min-heaps, respectively. Specifically, heaps are a type of binary tree, since each child node is either greater or less than its parent (depending on if it’s a max-heap or min-heap). They are efficient for accessing the root value, which will either be the max or min (again, depending on the type of heap) and inserting new values.

We use an array for storing internal elements, but we’re modeling it on a binary tree, where every parent element has up to two child elements.

Child and parent elements are determined by their relative indices within the internal heap. By doing some arithmetic on an element’s index, we can determine the indices for parent and child elements (if they exist).

Parent: (index / 2), rounded down
Left Child: index * 2
Right Child: (index * 2) + 1

## Implementation
```js
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [ null ];
    this.size = 0;
  }

  popMin() {
    if (this.size === 0) {
      return null 
    }
    const min = this.heap[1];
    this.heap[1] = this.heap[this.size];
    this.heap.pop();
    this.size--;
    this.heapify();
    return min;
  }

  add(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.size++;
    this.bubbleUp();
  }

  bubbleUp() {
    let current = this.size;
    let swapCount = 0;
    while (current > 1 && this.heap[getParent(current)] > this.heap[current]) {
      this.swap(current, getParent(current));
      current = getParent(current);
      swapCount++;
    }
    if (this.size == 10000) {
      console.log(`Heap of ${this.size} elements restored with ${swapCount} swaps`);
    }
  }

  heapify() {
    let current = 1;
    let leftChild = getLeft(current);
    let rightChild = getRight(current);
    let swapCount = 0;

    while (this.canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild)) {
      // Only compare left & right if they both exist
      if (this.exists(leftChild) && this.exists(rightChild)) {

        // Make sure to swap with the smaller of the two children
        if (this.heap[leftChild] < this.heap[rightChild]) {
          this.swap(current, leftChild);
          current = leftChild;
	        swapCount++;
        } else {
          this.swap(current, rightChild);
          current = rightChild;
	        swapCount++;
        }
      } else {
        // If only one child exist, always swap with the left
        this.swap(current, leftChild);
        current = leftChild;
	      swapCount++;
      }
      leftChild = getLeft(current);
      rightChild = getRight(current);

    }
    if (this.size == 9999) {
      console.log(`Heap of ${this.size} elements restored with ${swapCount} swaps`);
    }
  }

  exists(index) {
    return index <= this.size;
  }

  canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild) {
    // Check that one of the possible swap conditions exists
    return (
      this.exists(leftChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[leftChild]
      || this.exists(rightChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[rightChild]
    );
  }

  swap(a, b) {
    [this.heap[a], this.heap[b]] = [this.heap[b], this.heap[a]];
  }

}

const getParent = current => Math.floor((current / 2));
const getLeft = current => current * 2;
const getRight = current => current * 2 + 1;
