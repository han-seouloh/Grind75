# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble Sort
**How It Works?**
1. Compare adjacent elements in the array and swap if they are not in the intended order.
2. Repeat as you got through each element.
3. Once you go through the array with no swaps, the array is sorted.

Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array.

```
ie.
arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
bubbleSort(arr) => [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]
```

```js
const bubbleSort = (arr) => {
  let swap = false;
  do { // There are two loops and we go through the whole array in both loops. O(n^2)
    swap = false;
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i+1]) {
        let temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i+1] = temp;
        swap = true;
      }
    }
  } while (swap)
  return arr;
}
```

Visualization:
```
First iteration
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] => [-6, 20] don't need swapping.
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] => [20, 8] need to be swapped.
[-6, 8, 20, -2, 4] => [20, -2] need to be swapped.
[-6, 8, -2, 20, 4] => [20, 4] need to be swapped.

If there was any swapping, we iterate once more.

Second iteration
[-6, 8, -2, 4, 20] => [-6, 8] don't need swapping.
[-6, 8, -2, 4, 20] => [8, -2] need to be swapped.
[-6, -2, 8, 4, 20] => [8, 4] need to be swapped.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [8, 20] don't need swapping.

If there was any swapping, we iterate once more.

Third iteration
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [-6, -2] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [-2, 4] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [4, 8] don't need swapping.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] => [8, 20] don't need swapping.

There was no swapping in this iteration, so the array is sorted.
```

## Insertion Sort
**How It Works?**
1. Divide the array into a sorted and unsorted section.
2. In the first iteration the sorted section will only contain the first element of the array, while the unsorted section will be the rest of the array.
3. You take the first element of the unsorted section (the number to insert) and compare it to the sorted element to its left.
4. If the number to insert is greater than or equal to the sorted element leave it to the right of the sorted element and now this number forms part of the sorted section of the array.
5. While the number to insert is lower than the sorted elements it is being compared to, place the number to the left of the sorted element. Once it breaks the loop (Step 4) move on to the next unsorted element.
6. Once you go through the algorithm for the last element of the unsorted section of the array, the whole array is sorted. (If still unclear, view the visualization section.)

Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array.

```
ie.
const arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
insertionSort(arr) = [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]
```

```js
const insertionSort = (arr) => {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) { // This has a nested loop so this is O(n^2)
    let numToInsert = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > numToInsert) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }

    arr[j + 1] = numToInsert;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Visualization:
```
NTI = Number to insert (Second element after first sorted element)
SE = Sorted element (Assume first number is always sorted)
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] | NTI = 20 |  SE = -6 | 20 > -6, place 20 to the right of -6.
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] | NTI =  8 |  SE = 20 |  8 < 20, place 8 to the left of 20.
[-6, 8, 20, -2, 4] | NTI =  8 |  SE = -6 |  8 > -6, place 8 to the right of -6.
[-6, 8, 20, -2, 4] | NTI = -2 |  SE = 20 | -2 < 20, place -2 to the left of 20.
[-6, 8, -2, 20, 4] | NTI = -2 |  SE =  8 | -2 < 8, place -2 to the left of 8.
[-6, -2, 8, 20, 4] | NTI = -2 |  SE = -6 | -2 > -6, place -2 to the right of -6.
[-6, -2, 8, 20, 4] | NTI =  4 |  SE = 20 |  4 < 20, place 4 to the left of 20.
[-6, -2, 8, 4, 20] | NTI =  4 |  SE =  8 |  4 < 8, place 4 to the left of 8.
[-6, -2, 4, 8, 20] | NTI =  4 |  SE = -2 |  4 < -2, place 4 to the right of -2.

When we reach the end of the array, the array is sorted.
```

## Quick Sort
**How It Works?**
1. Identify the pivot element of the array.
   1. Pick the first element as the pivot.
   2. Pick the last element as the pivot. (Our approach)
   3. Pick a random element as the pivot.
   4. Pick median as the pivot.
2. Put everything that is smaller than the pivot into a 'left' array and everything that is greater than the pivot into a 'right' array;
3. Repeat the process for the individual 'left' and 'right' arrays until ou have an array of length 1 which is sorted by definition.
4. Repeatedly concatenate the left array, pivot and right array until one sorted array remains.

Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array.

```
ie.
const arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
quickSort(arr) = [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]
```

```js
const quickSort = (arr) => { // Worst case is O(n^2) in case the array is already sorted. Which won't be the case most of the time.
                             // Average case is O(nlogn) recursively half the input array O(logn) and there's a for loop in each recursion O(n).
  if (arr.length < 2) {
    return arr;
  }
  
  let pivot = arr[arr.length - 1],
      left = [],
      right = [];
  
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < pivot) {
      left.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      right.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}
```

```
Step 1:
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]

Level 1: Left = [-6, -2], Pivot = [4], Right = [8, 20]

Step 2 - Repeat for Left and Right:
[-6, -2]
Level 2: Left = [-6], Pivot = [-2], Right = []

[8, 20]
Level 2: Left = [8], Pivot = [20], Right = []

Step 3 - Start concatenation up starting from the lowest level:
Level 2: [-6][-2][] and [8][20][] => [-6, -2] & [8, 20];
Level 1: [-6, -2][4][8,20] => [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] The array is sorted.
```

## Merge Sort
**How It Works?**
1. Divide the array into sub arrays, each containing one element. (By definition an array of one element is already sorted.)
2. Repeatedly merge the sub arrays to produce new sorted sub arrays until there is only one sub array. (This array will be the sorted output array.)

Problem - Given an array of integers, sort the array.

```
ie.
const arr = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
mergeSort(arr) = [-6, -2, 4, 8, 20]
```

```js
const mergeSort = (arr) => {
  if (arr.length < 2) return arr; // Base case, if the array length is 1, return the array
  
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2); // Define the middle of the array.
  const leftArr = arr.slice(0, mid); // Store the left side of the array up to, but not including the middle element.
  const rightArr = arr.slice(mid); // Store the right side of the array starting from the middle element.

  const merge = (left, right) => { // Define merge function for when the recursive splitting of the array ends.
    const mergedArr = []; // Temporary array to merge the sub arrays in each iteration.
    
    while (left.length > 0 || right.length > 0) { // While the left or right arrays have at least 1 element.
      let pushValue;
      if (!left.length) { // If the left array is empty, push the values of the right array.
        pushValue = right.shift();
        mergedArr.push(pushValue);
      } else if (!right.length) { // If the right array is empty, push the values of the left array.
        pushValue = left.shift();
        mergedArr.push(pushValue);
      } else if (left[0] <= right[0]) { // If the first value of the left array is less than the right array's, 
        pushValue = left.shift();
        mergedArr.push(pushValue); // Push the first value of the left array.
      } else { // If they're equal or the right array's first element is lower,
        pushValue = right.shift();
        mergedArr.push(pushValue);// Push the first value of the right array.
      }
    } // Once we exit the loop, it means both arrays have been emptied into the newly merged and sorted sub array.

    return mergedArr; // Return said sub array.
  }

  return merge(mergeSort(leftArr), mergeSort(rightArr));
}
```

Step 1 - Split array into single element arrays by slicing it in half in each iteration.
[-6, 20, 8, -2, 4]
Level 1: [-6, 20] | [8, -2, 4]
Level 2: [-6] [20] | [8] | [-2, 4]
Level 3: [-6] [20] | [8] | [-2] [4]

Step 2 - Merge individual sub arrays into new sub arrays at each level while ensuring the elements are sorted.
Level 3: [-6] [20] = [] Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [] [20] = [-6] -6 < 20, and now since the left array is empty, push the first element of the right array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [-6, 20] When both sides are empty, this is the new sorted sub array.

         [8] [] = [] Right array is empty so push the first element of the left array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [8] Both sides are empty, this is the new sorted sub array.

         [-2] [4] = [] Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [] [4] = [-2] -2 < 4, and now since the left array is empty, push the first element of the right array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [-2, 4] When both sides are empty, this is the new sorted sub array.

Level 2: [-6, 20] [] = [] Right array is empty so push the first element of the left array into the temp. array.
         [20] [] = [-6] Right array is empty so push the first element of the left array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [-6, 20] When both sides are empty, this is the new sorted sub array.

         [8] [-2, 4] = [] Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [8] [4] = [-2] -2 < 8, Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [8] [] = [-2, 4] 4 < 8, and now since the right array is empty, push the first element of the left array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [-2, 4, 8] When both sides are empty, this is the new sorted sub array.

Level 1: [-6, 20] [-2, 4, 8] = [] Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [20] [-2, 4, 8] = [-6] -6 < -2, Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [20] [4, 8] = [-6, -2] -2 < 20, Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array. 
         [20] [8] = [-6, -2, 4] 4 < 20, Check arrays are not empty and compare the first element of each array. Push the smaller element to the temp. array.
         [20] [] = [-6, -2, 4, 8] 8 < 20, and now since the right array is empty, push the first element of the left array into the temp. array.
         [] [] = [-6, 20, 8, -2, 4] Both sides are empty and this is the last iteration of the algorithm. This is the final sorted array.
