# Data Structures
A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used effciciently. It is a collection of data values, the relationship among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

# Why Learn Data Structures?
To efficiently manage the data.
ie. If there is no efficient organization of books in a library it will take a lot more to look for the book you want. The method in which the books are organized can be seen as the data structures in code.

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.

Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory.
