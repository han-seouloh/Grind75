# Custom Data Structures
## Stack
Sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
- The last element inserted into the stack is the first element to be removed.
- Abstract data type defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
- Supports two main operations
  - Push: adds an element to the collection.
  - Pop: removes the most recently added element from the collection.

### Examples of Use
- Browser history tracking
- Undo operation when typing
- Expression conversions
- Call stack in Javascript Runtime

### Implementation
Operations we'll implement in this stack:
- push(val) - add an element to the top of the stack.
- pop() - remove the top most element from the stack.
- peek() - get the value of the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty() - check if the stack is empty.
- size() - get the number of elements in the stack.
- print() - visualize the elements in the stack.

```js
class Stack {
  constructor(arr = []) {
    this.items = [...arr];
  }

  push (element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }
  pop () {
    return this.items.pop();
  }
  peek () {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }
  isEmpty () {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
  size () {
    return this.items.length
  }
  print () {
    console.log(this.items.toString());
  }
}
```
